We investigate the challenges it poses for automated summarization by testing several models and comparing their results with those obtained on a corpus of news articles. We show that model-generated summaries of dialogues achieve higher ROUGE scores than the model-generated summaries of news {--} in contrast with human evaluators{'} judgement. This suggests that a challenging task of abstractive dialogue summarization requires dedicated models and non-standard quality measures. To our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to introduce a high-quality chat-dialogues corpus, manually annotated with abstractive summarizations, which can be used by the research community for further studies.\",\n}\n", "homepage": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12237", "license": "CC BY-NC-ND 4.0", "features": {"id": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "dialogue": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}, "summary": {"dtype": "string", "id": null, "_type": "Value"}}, "post_processed": null, "supervised_keys": null, "task_templates": null, "builder_name": "samsum", "config_name": "samsum", "version": {"version_str": "0.0.0", "description": null, "major": 0, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "splits": {"train": {"name": "train", "num_bytes": 9479117, "num_examples": 14732, "dataset_name": "samsum"}, "test": {"name": "test", "num_bytes": 534480, "num_examples": 819, "dataset_name": "samsum"}, "validation": {"name": "validation", "num_bytes": 516419, "num_examples": 818, "dataset_name": "samsum"}}, "download_checksums": {"https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum/resolve/main/data/corpus.7z": {"num_bytes": 2944100, "checksum": "a97674c66726f66b98a08ca5e8868fb8af9d4843f2b05c4f839bc5cfe91e8899"}}, "download_size": 2944100, "post_processing_size": null, "dataset_size": 10530016, "size_in_bytes": 13474116}}
